Disaster Management can be defined as the management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all humanitarian aspects of emergencies, in particular preparedness, response and recovery in order to lessen the impact of disasters. This project is based on a web application that provide victims a simple platform to seek help in case of a natural disaster and also make it easier for the rescuers to respond and provide necessary help to the victims. To achieve the task, we have built a complete front to back-end application based on different technologies and protocols which are discussed in detail in the following subsequent topics.
